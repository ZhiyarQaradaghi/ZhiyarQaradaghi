**`Software Engineer`** **`Tech Enthusiast`** **`Problem Solver`**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Zhiyar Qaradaghi, a passionate software engineer with a love for technology and a drive to tackle challenging problems. Here’s a bit about me:

🔭 Current Focus: I have collected quite a few skills and plan on learning more, however, I believe that it is important to try and fully master a skill rather than just learning basics and moving on.

🌱 Learning & Growth: I thrive on hard challenges and believe in learning from failures, as I have personally experienced and seen that a person with strong convictions will always come out on top of their failures.

💬 Let’s Connect: I’m always open to discussions about tech, design patterns, or anything cat-related. Feel free to reach out!
